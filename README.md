## ArtworkAuction

The ArtworkAuction contract is designed to facilitate the auctioning of artworks. Artists can list their artworks for auction, specify a starting price, and set a duration for the auction. Bidders can then place bids on these artworks. The highest bidder at the end of the auction duration wins the artwork. The contract ensures that the highest bid is always stored and that previous bidders get refunded if outbid.
